- 👋 Hi, I’m @matthewzenm, with an alias "Alkali the Mahou Shoujo".
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics and (La)TeX typing.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking undergraduate mathematics courses in my university, as well as learning Algebraic Geometry by my interest.
- ⌨️ I'm trying to exposure myself to (La)TeX development, though I just began the long run.
- 📫 You can email me at matthewzenm@163.com, or get access to my personal sns account by emailing to the previous address.

I'm using GitHub and ~~Gitee~~ (abandoned by 'well-known' reason) as hosting platform of my notes on various subjects,
most of them are in Chinese.

Sometimes we may use GitHub as a collaboration platform of TeX writing, instead of overleaf.
