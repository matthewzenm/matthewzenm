- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @matthewzenm, with an alias "Alkali the Mahou Shoujo".
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in mathematics and TeX typing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Modern Algebra and Algebraic Geometry.
- ðŸ“« You can email me at matthewzenm@163.com, or get access to my personal sns account by emailing.

I'm using GitHub and Gitee as hosting platform of my notes on various subjects,
most of them are in Chinese.

Sometimes we may use GitHub as a collaboration platform of TeX writing, instead of overleaf.
